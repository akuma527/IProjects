    "Statistics is usually a weak spot for many starting on Data Science, and I don't need to reinforce how fundamental this discipline is on the particular field. The content you will go through on this Kernel comes originally from the \"Statistical Thinking II\" chapter on  [**Data Camp**](http://www.datacamp.com/home), a fantastic platform leading Data Science Education and where I found myself devoted on personal studies to aquire my python skills as well as the \"data logical thinking\". [**Data Camp**](http://www.datacamp.com/home) solves the Data Science curriculum problem for beginner data enthusiasts, in case you are in this position, go check them out!\n",

    "The working dataset here comes from [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.g6g3h) repository. The reaserch conduced by Peter and Rosemary Grant has shown that these changes in populations can happen very quickly. The British couple, both evolutionary biologists at Princeton University, have spent six months every year capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches (small birds) on the island **since 1973**. On this kernel we will use part of the data compiled to assess hypothesis tests while practicing the best practices of exploratory data analysis.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusions and references on correlation and p-value analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, this was one of my favorite topics so far, and even though most people go directly to machine learning and deep learning the statistical concepts here explored are a crucial part of the foundation to build good models and optimize existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P-value:\n",
    "Initially, I thought that p-value analysis was a boolean thing, it's either less than 0.01 or \"statistically significant\" or higher meaning \"it happens due to randomness\". This is stressed more than one time by [**Data Camp**](http://www.datacamp.com/home), such analysis should not be carried in a True or False scenario, the p-value is way more complex than most people think. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation:\n",
    "After the course, correlation techniques started being part of my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) toolbox. Correlations address the necessity of increasing modeling efficience while enhancing the big picture of data understanding when used together with visualizations. Phenomenon such as multicollinearity effects were completely new to me while being simple and powerful concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### References:\n",
    "During my studies I found very good references regarding both topics that I would like to share as a further reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Science Isn't Broken](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1) article by [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) shown a very complicated scenario where p-values are so determinant for publishing a scientific paper nowadays that scientists are hacking statistical analysis in order to achieve significance. They provide an interactive dashboard where you can try it yourself \"hacking data for being published\". The \"Science's magic number\" is also discussed in the same aspect by [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/rethinking-sciences-magic-number/?utm_campaign=News&utm_medium=Community&utm_source=DataCamp.com).\n",
    "* The \"Introduction to Correlation\" blog from [datascience.com](http://https://www.datascience.com/learn-data-science/fundamentals/introduction-to-correlation-python-data-science) was an outstanding source for going deeper from covariance passing by Pearson and Spearman correlations with simple examples. Special note to their explanation regarding \"Correlation and Causation\" where according to data there was a high correlation for babies in Germany being delivered by storks. \n",
    "The same line of reasoning, and critic joke behind, is explored by [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), in case you haven't heard of them, be mindful of their last analysis where there is a 99.76% correlation between US spendings on science, space, and technology and Suicides by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation. Correlation implies causation? Not always!  \n"
